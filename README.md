# Color Picker

This is a cool little project to select a color!

It was fun to research and use the input element and how it can be used to select a color and changing the background color of the body using the var() function in CSS!

## Running

No npm, no node_modules, nothing! It's great. All you need to do is clone the project and open the index.html!
